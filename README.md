# thesis

This thesis focuses on the design, implementation, and supervision of 20 kV medium voltage overhead distribution lines, following the standards set by the Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network Operator (HEDNO). It encompasses both electrical and mechanical studies, including load calculations, conductor sag analysis, pole strength evaluations, and voltage drop assessments. The research provides practical guidelines for optimizing line performance, minimizing energy losses, and ensuring structural integrity under varying environmental conditions.
